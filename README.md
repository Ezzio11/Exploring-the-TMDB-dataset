# Movie Analysis Project  

This project analyzes the evolution of movies from 1960 to 2015 using **The Movie Database (TMDB)** dataset. By exploring financial success, popularity, runtime trends, and genre profitability, the analysis sheds light on the factors that contribute to a movie's success or failure. Conducted using **Python**, the project leverages powerful libraries to uncover insights and visualize patterns in the movie industry.

## **Overview**  
Movies, a long-form storytelling medium, have evolved significantly since the days of Georges Méliès and his 3-minute masterpieces. From intimate productions to the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe, the industry has grown in complexity, cost, and impact. This project seeks to analyze the TMDB dataset to answer key questions about movie success and failure.

The dataset spans **1960 to 2015** and includes details on budget, revenue, runtime, popularity, and genres.

## **Objectives**  
This project aims to answer the following questions:  
1. **Financial Success**: What are the most financially successful movies?  
2. **Box Office Failures**: Which movies "bombed" at the box office?  
3. **Popularity**: What are the most popular movies?  
4. **Runtime Trends**: Did movies get longer or shorter over time?  
5. **Budget vs. Revenue**: Does spending more money on a movie result in higher revenue?  
6. **Genre Profitability**: Which genres made the highest profit?  

By answering these questions, the analysis provides insights into the best and worst-performing movies, helping to identify patterns that contribute to success or failure.
